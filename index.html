<h2>Escape-Flyer</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Fly a little dude forward, avoiding blocks and the glowing bar until the end.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel anxious about succeeding but be able to win with practice.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Variation on a platformer game
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Story:</strong>
Player flies in a bizarre magical tunnel resembling the 70s. Abstract. Pointless.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Click and hold the mouse in the direction of desired movement. Be ready, because
the game isn't going to wait for you!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The prototype is intended to evaluate whether gameplay is too challenging or 
too simple and should  be playtested to see if the experience goals are met.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Bored teens and adults searching for the next Flappy Bird or Robot Unicorn Attack
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Should take about 2 minutes to beat the game at its current length.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Don't take any advantage over the bar for granted. It speeds up over time.
</li>

<li><strong>Assets:</strong>
Bar was made in GIMP by me.
Flyer character was made by user dogchicken of OpenGameArt.org
Default box part of Phaser release 1.1.6
Cut the Kid by Madeon, free download off his website
</li>

<li><strong>Closest Phaser Example:</strong>
Uses Plamsa filter almost identical to original. 
Controls based on follow mouse example.
