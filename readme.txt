Code Structure:
	Games states are basic [boot, preloader, menu, game]
	Game structure separated by power-ups and physics functions
		Lots of scripting to make rain successful
		Win conditions and lose condition functions
		Each power-up and main mode are blocked out

How to Play:
	Move the mouse around the screen to move Flyer
	(When in Snag mode) Hover mouse over a block to move
	Press 'R' to restart the game

Credits:
	Photonstorm of Phaser fame gave us much framework and effects
	Every member of this group put in hard work and maybe sweat
	At least Moose put in tears, as well
